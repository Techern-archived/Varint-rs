[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Techern/Varint-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Techern/Varint-rs)  [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/varint.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/varint) 

Please note: This does **not** provide stream or buffer APIs for reading and writing varints. That is up to you to implement, but may be added in a future release here after an implementation in Netherrack
